# HireThem
HackNU hackathon project repository.

We as a team have committed to resolve the problem of the invasion and dependency over a third party for some of the very basic daily availability of helpers and workers. The problem we are looking at can be termed as “Third Party System” or “Mediator drawback”. We want to make a transparent deal and reliable communication system in which we all can share our required information to get hired by some people to earn our livelihoods directly without anybody’s self-interest.
